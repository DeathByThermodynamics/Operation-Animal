# Operation-Animal
Source code for my elementary mathematics educational game created for the UofT Research Opportunity Program.

The game is written in Unity and follows an animal theme; the goal is to teach elementary students the order of operations.
This game will be used in conjunction with a math anxiety sensor to measure the effectiveness of games on reducing elementary math anxiety around different concepts.
